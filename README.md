🌱 Know Your Crop

Know Your Crop is a web-based project designed to help farmers and agricultural enthusiasts make better crop choices using district-specific soil, climate, and market data. Instead of relying only on the major crops traditionally grown in an area, this tool suggests alternative crops that can bring higher profitability and sustainability.

📊 NPK Calculator – Analyze Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K) levels to determine soil nutrient balance and recommended crops.

🌾 Alternative Crops Suggestion – Provides farmers with alternative crop options beyond the commonly grown major crops, helping them diversify and increase demand for less grown crops.
